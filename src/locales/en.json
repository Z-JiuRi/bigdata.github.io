  "courseIntroContent": "In the era of Big Data, discovering the characteristics behind the data and using them has become the mainstream thinking in current business operations. In the course of Big Data Analysis and Practice, students will systematically learn the specific process of scientific research work, combined with specific fields, such as computer vision, natural language processing, virtual reality, etc. To fully explore the characteristics of massive data, complete a specific project, innovate mainstream algorithms, and finally complete a high-quality paper, so as to cultivate students' abilities in discovering problems, acquiring knowledge, document retrieval, and algorithm optimization.",
  "courseDesc": "Course Description",
  "courseDescContent": "Practices on Data Analysis is one of the most important course in the major of Data Science and Technology. Students will be able to build a complete knowledge on data management, data analysis, data mining, data visualization and human-computer interaction. This course will be driven by experiments, which will strengthen understandings of fundamental theories, cultivate the ability to solve complex engineering problems by using multi-cross disciplines (e.g., Mathematics, Natural Science, Engineering, etc.), and the research ability to solve problems.",
  "aims": "Teaching Objectives",
  "aims1": "This course will focus on the needs of interactive data processing and analysis, and will comprehensively teach theoretical knowledge and practical operational capabilities in data processing, data mining, data analysis, and data visualization.",
  "aims2": "In terms of theoretical knowledge, based on the current advanced data interactive system and the theoretical basis of technical explanations, discuss how to improve the performance of the next-generation data processing system through interactive technology, and how to give the data processing system interactive analysis and decision-making capabilities. It mainly describes the theoretical basis and common knowledge of data management, data mining, data visualization, etc.",
  "aims3": "As for practical operation, it is guided by comprehensive scientific research topics, guiding students to make practical contributions in the topic research, and guiding interested students to participate in the National University Big Data Application Innovation Competition. Scientific research topics include but are not limited to: exploration in AR and VR; commercial visualization analysis; text sentiment analysis; two-dimensional human skeleton body posture estimation. In terms of evaluation, the proportion of actual operation ability scores will be increased, and the training of students' scientific research ability and practical ability will be emphasized.",
  "request": "Goals",
  "requestContent": "Through the study of this course, the following abilities will be cultivated:",
  "requestContent1": "Engineering knowledge. Through the study of this course, students have a solid theoretical foundation of data mining and data visualization, and through practical teaching links such as big data visualization analysis and application innovation, students will eventually have the basic ability to develop big data application systems.",
  "requestContent2": "Comprehensive application capabilities. Students understand the interrelationships of data management, data analysis, data mining, data visualization, and human-computer interaction, and can grasp the overall method and architecture when designing and implementing big data application innovation systems, and complete high-quality design and development.",
  "requestContent3": "Research capacity. Add cutting-edge research content of data mining and data visualization to the teaching content, and improve students' ability to ask questions, solve problems, and analyze problems through practical projects. At the end of the semester, each student is required to submit a research essay (4 pages + 1 reference）。",
  "requestContent4": "Communication skills. Through group communication, classroom report, report writing, etc., students' communication skills are cultivated, so that students can quickly acquire new knowledge and new information. Students are required to report their research progress in the middle and at the end of the semester.",
