> 方博文 宋家庆 苗琳瑜 张一凡 吴祥钧

Ancient poetry is a special style in Chinese literature, which carries the splendid culture of Chinese civilization with a long history and endless life, it is a perfect fusion carrier of philosophy and aesthetics, and is the treasure of Chinese traditional culture and the essence of traditional spirit. Learning and mastering the knowledge of ancient Chinese poetry and analyzing the connections between them is a good way to understand the development of Chinese civilization and even human civilization. In order to explore the hidden information in ancient poetry, we start from the essence of ancient poetry, analyze the data of ancient poetry from four aspects: time, geography, emotion and category, and make a poetry visualization system. However, the traditional data analysis methods are often ineffective when applied directly to the ancient poetry dataset, and we modify the ancient poetry dataset according to local conditions for the two tasks of text clustering and sentiment analysis. At the same time, in terms of visualization, we combine visual form with the traditional Chinese art style, so that poetry data can better convey the hidden historical information.

Ancient poetry is the essence of traditional Chinese culture and occupies an important position in the splendid ancient culture of China. They are not only rich in connotation, all-embracing and profound in meaning, with high aesthetic value and strong artistic influence, but also have concise language, short and concise, beautiful words and rhymes, which make them unique in the Chinese literary world. Therefore, we analyze and visualize the data of ancient poems from four perspectives of emotion, category, time and geography, taking into account the following factors.

- Poets write poems to express their thoughts, ambitions, and aspirations.

- The themes of poetry can often be classified as a border, garden, farewell, etc. The techniques or intentions used in different categories of poetry are very different.

- In the long history, poems often reflect the changes of a dynasty or era, and the policies of a dynasty can greatly influence the enthusiasm for poetry.

- There are many famous places in China, and poets in ancient times often traveled to the mountains and rivers, using them to express their emotions, and different places are often rich in different historical heritage.

In addition to the above tasks, we also implemented three tasks: similar poetry search, poetry continuation, and generation of hidden poems, in order to enrich interactivity and add further insight into the mysteries of ancient.
